# Type The Platform

Your web your way, type-safe and extendable.

## What is Type The Platform?

Type The Platform is founded on two important facts in the Web Development world;

1. Most developers like type safety
2. Existing solutions are compromising on the developer experience

These reasons are why we're building our compiler, [SupaSet][supaset-stand-for], which aims to bring
an extensible type system to The Web Platform.

## Goals & Promises

We aim;

- To be the most powerful, extensible, and efficient type system for The Web Platform - by far
- To create a seamless developer experience
- To go beyond just type-checking to find errors and bugs before they happen
- To provide simple and powerful APIs for integrating with existing tools and libraries
  - We also aim to provide enough tools directly to make integrating with others unnecessary -
  though you will always be able to do so
- To provide automatic recognition of existing Web Platform type systems
  - We also aim to provide automatic migration from existing type systems to SupaSet - and back
  again if you change your mind

We promise;

- To never require you to pay for anything. Ever.
- To accept the opinions and desires of the community over our own
- To be fully compatible with all current and future JavaScript standards
- To never use reserved keywords for our own purposes
- To **never** make a breaking change when introducing or modifying features
  - We may deprecate some features, but they will always be there, and we will always support bug
  fixes

## Current & Future Projects

- SupaSet Compiler
  - Compiler Plugins
  - Compile-Time Macros
- SupaSet Language Server

## 'I Have a Question'

We might have an answer. Check below for some questions we've anticipated.

### What Does SupaSet Stand For?

[supaset-stand-for]: #what-does-supaset-stand-for

SupaSet stands for **S**trategically **U**pgrading the **P**latform with an **A**mazing **S**ystem
for **E**xtensible **T**ypes, because that's what we're doing.
